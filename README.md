# APD
## The AusTraits Plant Dictionary

The AusTraits Plant Dictionaryy includes the trait definitions used by AusTraits, a database of Australian plant traits. Upon its release in 2023, the APD will include definitions for nearly 500 traits pertaining to plant functional ecology and plant morphology. Each trait definition has been reviewed by multiple people and includes references and links to identical/similar traits in other trait databases whenever possible. APD will be machine-readable, allowing the traits to be readily re-used by other databases. 

Each trait includes the following fields:
* trait name (label)
* trait ID
* expected units (for numeric traits; all units aligned to UCUM standards)
* allowable range (for numeric traits)
* allowable trait values (for categorical traits; all trait values are themselves defined)
* trait definition (A definition with technical terms linked to published ontologies as well as, when applicable, longer definitions and comments
* keywords
* a trait hierarchy
* references
* names/ORCIDs of people who have reviewed the trait definition
* links to identical/similar/related traits in other plant trait databases
