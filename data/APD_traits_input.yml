    It is commonly referred to as "DBH".
  comments: This trait is always meant to be measured at "breast height", 1.4 m above
    the ground surface. However, for short plants this will not always be the case,
    so it is advised to read the methods to confirm at what height plant diameters
    have been recorded. This trait is not meant to document the DBH of all individuals
    sampled, but instead the maximum DBH for a typical mature individual within a
    population or across a taxon.

    shoot system [PO:0025607] of a climbing plant that is not self-supporting and
    therefore has a height that depends on the surrounding vegetation.
  description: Maximum vertical height of the vegetative shoot system of a non-self-supporting
    taxon (i.e. a vine, liana, or other climbing plant) in a given location.
  comments: While this trait is intended to indicate the height of climbing plants,
    the height of an epiphyte relative to the soil surface could also be documented
    here. All heights reported for this trait will be dependent on the height of the
    surrounding vegetation.

    the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole is included
    in or excluded from the leaf area measurements. For terete leaves, leaf area should
    still be recorded as the 2-dimensional projected area.

  comments: This trait refers to the single line marking the maximum width of the
    leaf lamina. For a compound leaf the correct measure is the maximum width of the
    total leaf blade. It is the width measure that will be reported in taxonomic treatments.
    It is not the `effective_leaf_width`, a trait that records the diameter of the
    largest circle that can be drawn within the leaf lamina. If a leaf analogue (leaflet,
    cladode, or phyllode) is measured instead of a true leaf, this should be noted

    leaf thickness measurements from the taxonomic literature will usually include
    any veins or midribs, because in this literature leaf thickness is generally measured
    on succulent plants. The `methods` field should document whether the midrib was
    explicitly included, excluded, or ignored.

  trait: leaf_dry_mass
  label: Leaf dry mass
  description_encoded: A leaf mass trait [TO:0000505] which is the dry [PATO:0001824]
    mass [PATO:0000125] of a leaf [PO:0025034] or leaf analogue (a leaflet [PO:0020049],
    cladode [PO:0025354], or phyllode [PO:0025335]).
  description: The oven dry mass of a leaf or leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, phyllode).
  comments: This trait includes measurements of leaves and leaf analogues, including
    leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
    the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as a
    `context` or under `measurement_remarks`. Leaflet dry mass can alternatively be
    mapped to the trait `leaflet_dry_mass`. It is most common for leaf dry mass measurements
    to include the petiole; the measurement methods should indicate if the petiole
    is included in or excluded from the leaf dry mass measurements.

    a leaflet [PO:0020049], cladode [PO:0025354], or phyllode [PO:0025335].
  description: The fresh mass of a leaf or leaf analogue (leaflet, cladode, phyllode).

    leaflets, cladodes, and phyllodes. When a measurement is made on a leaf analogue,
    the tissue measured should be documented as part of the methods or noted as a

    A source of variation for this trait will be how leaves are stored and if they
    are partially rehydrated before weighing; these details should be documented in
    the methods.

    including the arrangement of the lobes or leaflets relative to the midrib or other

  comments: This trait provides detailed description of leaf divisions, beyond what
    is captured in `leaf_compoundness` (simple versus compound) and `leaf_lobation`
    (entire versus lobed). The term 'divided' is meant to indicate lobing, such as
    "trichotomously divided", but as 'divided' is also used in some context to indicate
    the divisions of leaves into leaflets, it is avoided as a trait value for this
    trait.

  comments: This trait captures the presence or absence of hairs on mature (fully
    expanded), adult phase leaves on adult plants. Best practice is to sample leaves
    that are recently fully expanded, since older leaves have often shed many of their
    hairs. The accompanying methods should specify if the trait was scored on the

  trait: flower_anther_connective_extension
  label: Connective extension (apical)
  description_encoded: An androecium morphology trait [TO:0000994] which is whether
    anthers [PO:0009066] have protrusions [NCIT:C50710] that extend above the two
    theca [PO:0009069] (pollen [PO:0025281] sacs), and, if present, the shape [PATO:0000052]
    and the relative length [PATO:0000122] of the protrusion relative to the length
    of the entire anther.
  description: Apical (distal) connective extensions (also called 'distal connective
    protrusions') are sterile anther structures that distally extend beyond the level
    of the thecae (i.e., the two lateral pairs of pollen sacs of a tetrasporangiate
    anther).
  comments: This trait records both absence or presence of anther connective extensions
    and also the shape of these extensions in terms of length in relation to the length
    of the thecae. Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al.

  description: Orientation of anther at anthesis.
  comments: Anthers of angiosperms are rather uniform in their basic structure. They
    normally have four microsporangia (pollen sacs) that are arranged pair-wise in
    two thecae. The two microsporangia of a theca usually release their pollen grains
    through a common opening (stomium). Often, it is difficult to establish anther
    orientation clearly in a flower as this is a gradual feature with many intermediate
    stages. Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)

  comments: The width of the filament may thus either be broad as in laminar (e.g.,
    Eupomatiaceae) or bulky stamens (e.g., Chloranthaceae), or narrow (filamentous)
    as found in many core eudicots groups (e.g., Rosaceae). This trait is considered

  description: The fusion of filaments with the innermost perianth organs at anthesis
    on a continuous scale, from 0 (filaments completely free from perianth) to 1 (filaments
    fused along their entire length with the perianth; the 'entire length' of the
    filament is defined as the distance between the floral base and the joint between
    filament and anther).
  comments: Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate number between these two
    extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the
    length of perianth parts). If two (or more) stamen whorls (including staminodial
    whorls) differ in their extent of filament fusion with the perianth, this trait
    is recorded as a range of values. For example, if the filaments of an outermost
    stamen whorl are fused, up to 90% of their length, but an inner whorl only up
    to 50%, the trait is assigned a range of 0.5 to 0.9. The rationale for this is
    to provide a general trait that allows comparison of fusion among all angiosperms.

    [PATO:0000140] of the ovules [PO:0020003] within the ovary [PO:0009072], known
    as placentation [APD:glossary/40074].
  description: The different types of placentation in apocarpous/unicarpellate and
    in syncarpous gynoecia.
  comments: In apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia, placentation is often described
    as marginal as the ovules are usually attached along the ventral slit (i.e., the
    zone where the carpel margins become postgenitally closed during carpel development).
    In syncarpous gynoecia there are three main types of placentation, 1) axile placentation
    refers to ovaries where the ovules are placed in the angle between carpel flanks
    in the center of the ovary; 2) in ovaries with parietal placentation the ovules
    attach to the ovary wall where two carpels meet; 3) in ovaries with free-central
    placentation the ovules are attached to a central column that emerges from the
    base of the ovary and protrudes into the non-septate ovary. It is not unusual
    that syncarpous gynoecia show a transition from proximally axile to a distally
    parietal placentation (e.g., Polemoniaceae). Basal and apical placentation may
    occur both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. Usually there
    is one longitudinal series of ovules attached to each carpel margin. However,
    both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia there may be more
    than one series of ovules at the flanks of a carpel. These latter cases are referred
    to as laminar (or laminar-diffuse) placentation (e.g., in some Nymphaeaceae).
    A placenta that is protruding from its surroundings and has more than two series
    of ovules (either axile or parietal) is called protruding-diffuse. Definition
    and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020) for their character

    organs [PO:0009008], in particular whether the ovary is attached above or below
    the perianth [PO:0009058] organs (the petals [PO:0009032] and sepals [PO:0009031]).
  description: The position of the flower ovary relative to the insertion level of
    the remaining floral organs.
  comments: The ovary is the part of the gynoecium where the ovules are produced.
    The ovary may be located on the receptacle and thus be positioned above the insertion
    level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is superior and the flower
    is hypogynous). Alternatively, the ovary may be embedded in the receptacle and
    therefore be located below the insertion level of the remaining floral organs
    (i.e., the ovary is inferior and the flower is epigynous). Flowers with a hypanthium
    may either have a superior ovary (perigyny; e.g., many Rosaceae) or an inferior
    ovary (epiperigyny). It is also possible that the ovary is inferior to a certain
    degree only, such as half-inferior, if the receptacle is surrounding the ovary
    to its mid-level. Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al.

  trait: flower_perianth_differentiation
  label: Perianth differentiation
  description_encoded: A floral organ morphology trait [TO:0000862] which indicates
    whether petals [PO:0009032] and sepals [PO:0009031] are differentiated or identical
    and the various ways they can be identical or different.
  description: The ways in which perianth organs may look different from each other
    in a given flower.
  comments: Typically, outer perianth parts are sepaloid and protect the other floral
    organs during floral development, while inner organs are often petaloid and play
    a role in pollinator attraction (Endress, 1994). However, it is also possible
    that all parts are either sepaloid or petaloid but remain differentiated in shape,
    size, and/or texture. In case of spiral perianths, differentiation may be continuous
    (i.e., gradual), whereby two successively initiated organs are very similar or
    only slightly different, while the outermost and innermost organs at both ends
    of the spiral are very different from each other (e.g., Chimonanthus). In the
    special case of perianths consisting of a single whorl, they are scored as undifferentiated.
    This perianth differentiation trait may be seen as both functional (the parting
    vs. sharing of functions among perianth parts) and developmental (the expression
    of a genetic program for different forms of perianth parts vs. a single program
    for a single type of perianth part morphology). Within-whorl differentiation,
    whereby organs of the same whorl take different forms, is common in zygomorphic
    flowers (e.g., Balsaminaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae) but is not taken into account
    with this trait. This trait is not applicable when the perianth is absent. Definition

  description_encoded: A floral organ morphology trait [TO:0000862] which is the proportion
    [PATO:0001470] of the length [PATO:0000122] of perianth [PO:0009058] parts (sepals
    [PO:0009031], petals [PO:0009032], and tepals [PO:0009033]) that are fused [NCIT:C124537]
    together at anthesis [PO:0009068].
  description: Fusion of perianth organs (congenital or postgenital) at anthesis,
    recorded on a continuous scale, from 0 (free parts) to 1 (parts fused along their
    entire length).
  comments: Partial fusion was recorded using an approximate number between these
    two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half
    of the length of perianth parts). In case of multiple whorls, this trait records
    within-whorl fusion. For example, if organs within each whorl are fused along
    their entire length, a trait value of 1 is recorded. In cases where organs of
    two whorls are fused into a common tubular structure, such as frequently observed
    in monocots (e.g., Polygonatum), the perianth is considered to be fused. If the
    two (or more) whorls differed in their extent of fusion, a range of trait values
    may be recorded. For example, if the calyx is only basally fused, up to 10% of
    its length, but the corolla is entirely fused, a range of 0.1 to 1 is recorded
    as the trait value for the species. Definition derived from Schoenenberger et

    Less frequently, perianth phyllotaxis may be irregular. Perianth phyllotaxis at
    anthesis may differ from phyllotaxis of perianth part primordia at their inception

  description: The largest dimension of the pollen grain.
  comments: Palynologists typically describe pollen dimensions (and shape) using two
    measures, the polar axis (P) and the total breadth or diameter of the equatorial
    axis. Here we use P or E or another measure, whichever is the longest.

  label: Number of structural carpels
  description_encoded: A floral organ morphology trait [TO:0000862] which is the count
    [NCIT:C25463] of both fertile [PATO:0000955] and female sterile [PATO:0000892]
    carpels [PO:0009030] in a hermaphrodite [PATO:0001340] flower [PO:0009046] or
    female [PATO:0000383] flower.
  description: Number of fertile or sterile carpels in bisexual or female flowers,
    recorded as a continuous character (with integer values of 1 and above).
  comments: Includes the number of co-occurring carpellodes (sterile carpels) because
    this number is often more easily obtained from the literature than the actual
    number of fertile carpels. However, the number of carpellodes in male flowers
    is ignored for this character. In multicarpellate, unilocular gynoecia with complete
    carpel fusion up to the stigma (e.g., Primula), it may be difficult to assess
    the number of carpels unequivocally. In such cases, the number of carpels is scored
    only if it is well established based on atomical or developmental investigations.
    Similarly, in gynoecia where one or more carpels are reduced (e.g., in the pseudomonomerous
    gynoecia of some Arecaceae, Stauffer et al., 2002), the total number of structural
    carpels is only scored when unequivocally determined in the literature. Definition
    derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020) for their character '401. Number of
    structural carpels (C1)'

  description: Dry mass of a mature seed, including both oven dried and air-dried
    samples.
  comments: Standard methods people will have used to dry seeds include, 'fresh' (at
    dispersal, mature); 'air dried' (at local ambient conditions); 'seed bank air
    dried' (to 15% relative humidity); and 'oven dried' (>100 deg C for a set number
    of hours; e.g. seed bank standard is 103 deg C for 17 hours). It is expected that
    some observations in AusTraits mapped onto 'seed_dry_mass' will actually include
    both the seed and some dispersal tissue, if the two cannot easily be separated;
    these should be mapped to 'diaspore_dry_mass'.

    There will be additional values mapped as either 'seed_dry_mass' or 'fruit_dry_mass'
    that are also diaspores, but have identified only as being a 'seed' or 'fruit'.
    In addition, it is expected that some observations in AusTraits mapped onto 'seed_dry_mass'

  comments: Variation in methods used will mean that, in some cases, values are not
    perfectly comparable across studies. The expected units for this trait, N is the
    same as J/m; Newtons are a unit of force, while Joules are a unit of work, indicating
    how much work (force per distance) is done when force is applied. (Work to tear
    is also sometimes reported in J.)

  description_encoded: Maximum [NCIT:C25564] carboxylation [MOP:0000591] rate [PATO:0000161]
    by the Rubisco complex [GO:0048492] in plant leaves [PO:0025034], recorded per
    unit leaf [PO:0025034] mass [PATO:0000125]. The value is a model parameter [STATO:0000034]
    derived from the initial slope of a photosynthesis [GO:0015979] A-ci response
    curve, the component that is carbon dioxide [CHEBI:16526] limited and hence limited
    by Rubisco activity.
  description: The apparent maximum rate of Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase)
    activity carboxylase activity (carboxylation capacity), recorded per unit leaf
    mass. This is a model-derived value, calculated from the portion of an A-ci response
    curve (curve showing the photosynthetic response to increasing carbon dioxide
    concentrations) at low carbon dioxide concentrations. This is the portion of the
    curve where the photosynthetic rate is limited by the Rubisco activity.
  comments: Vcmax values are very dependent on leaf temperature, so leaf temperature
    needs to be included as a context property.

  description_encoded: A stem [PO:0009047] water transport [GO:0006833] trait which
    is a measure of the rate [PATO:0000161] of water [CHEBI:15377] movement [NCIT:C37994]
    through a stem under a specific [NCIT:C38024] driving force [PATO:0001035] (water
    potential [EnvThes:22311] gradient [NCIT:C70693]), accounting for the stem length
    [PATO:0000122]. It is calculated as the ratio [PATO:0001470] of the water flow
    [NCIT:C41141] rate through the stem segment (kg/s) to the water potential gradient
    across the stem segment (MPa), multiplied by the path length measured (m).

    It is calculated as the ratio of the water flow rate (kg/s) to the water potential
    gradient (MPa) across the stem segment, multiplied by the stem length (m).
  comments: This trait should not be confused with hydraulic conductance (kh),  which
    is the ratio of water flow flow rate to the water potential gradient across the
    stem segment, but IS NOT normalised to the path length and has units kg/MPa/s.

  description: kleaf; Measure of how efficiently water is transported through a leaf.
    It is calculated as the ratio of water flow rate through the leaf (mmol/s) to
    the water potential gradient from the petiole to mesophyll substomatal cavities
    (MPa), divided by the leaf area (1/m2). As this is a measure of "conductance"
    not "conductivity" the measurement is not normalised to the path length (the leaf
    length).
  comments: This trait is also sometimes referred to as 'Leaf specific conductivity'
    in the literature despite the fact it is not normalised to path length and therefore
    is a "conductance" not a "conductivity".

    curve [APD:glossary/40124], which is, for a leaf [PO:0025034], the ratio [PATO:0001470]
    of the mass [PATO:0000125] of water [CHEBI:15377] in the leaf at the turgor [PATO:0001620]
    loss point to the mass of water in the leaf at full hydration (saturated [NCIT:C61427];
    relative water content = 100%).
  description: Ratio of the mass of water in leaf at the point the leaf cells lose
    turgor to the mass of water in a fully saturated leaf. A fully saturated leaf
    is one which has been rehydrated to hold the maximum amount of water and is considered
    to have a relative water content of 100%. The plant's turgor loss point is calculated
    from a pressure-volume curve.

  description_encoded: A whole plant [PO:0000003] phenotype [NCIT:C16977] trait that
    summarises different components of a whole plant's shape [PATO:0000052] and structure
    [PATO:0000141] into general groups [NCIT:C43359]. Characters that contribute to
    the plant form categories include the height [PATO:0000119] of the vegetative
    shoot system [PO:0025607], the distribution of leaves [PO:0025034] along the plant
    stem [PO:0009047], and the position [PATO:0000140] and count [NCIT:C25463] of
    stems and/or leaves relative to the ground surface.
  description: The form of a plant, capturing a general sense of plant height and
    shape, which parts of a plant are woody versus herbaceous, the number of stems
    arising at ground level, and the distribution of leaves relative to the main stem.
  comments: This definition of plant growth form is narrower than what is used by
    many other references. Here, information pertaining to where a plant grows is
    captured by `plant_growth_substrate`. Terminology about the shape and length of
    stems and distribution of leaves is included in `stem_growth_habit`. An indication
    of whether a plant is parasitic is presented in `parasitic`. Included in the list
    of plant growth forms are two terms that are exclusively used to describe Australian
    plants, mallee and hummock, and one, tussock, that is an important growth form
    of Australian grasses, but globally used less frequently.

  description: Categorical description of the duration of a plant's lifespan, from
    germination to death.
  comments: Studies will differ in the subset of terms they use to describe a plant's
    life history, such that some researchers will distinguish between ephemeral and
    annual species, and other researchers will group these life history categories
    together under `annual`. In addition, only a subset of studies will use the term
    `short-lived perennial`; the majority will score all perennial plants as `perennial`.
    Rangeland studies and post-fire studies are those most likely to score species
    as `ephemeral` or `short-lived perennial`, as these are environments where perennial
    species' lifespans are often divided into those that are short-lived due to environmental
    conditions and those that are able to persist through the environmentally unfavourable
    period.

  description_encoded: A whole plant [PO:0000003] life history [ECOCORE:00000018]
    trait which indicates either the substrate [EFO:0005061] on which a plant grows
    [GO:0040007] or, broadly, whether the plant grows in an aquatic [EnvThes:21785]
    or terrestrial [EnvThes:21880] habitat [ENVO:01000739]. Substrate is defined as
    the surface to which an organism is attached.
  description: Trait broadly indicating where a plant is usually found, referencing
    the habitat in which a plant grows, the substrate to which a plant is attached,
    or a plant's growth medium.
  comments: Although the majority of vascular plants are `terrestrial`, for most taxonomic
    groups `plant growth substrate` is only recorded if a plant is not terrestrial.
    The exceptions are ferns and orchids, where both floras and individual researchers
    tend to specifically indicate which taxa are terrestrial. The values under this
    trait are recorded as part of `plant growth form` by many researchers, trait handbooks,
    and databases; they have been split out here, as the terms capturing what a plant
    is attached to do not generally describe the form of a plant.

  description: Trait indicating a plant's primary photosynthetic organ or tissue.
  comments: This trait is not intended to record the presence of primary versus secondary
    photosynthetic organs; only the primary photosynthetic organ should be keyed in.
    Many of the allowable values for this trait are frequently included under `leaf
    type` or `leaf form`. Here, we separate terms pertaining to the general form of
    the leaf (in the trait `leaf_type`) from those identifying the plant organ responsible
    for photosynthesis.

  description: Trait indicating the strategies used by a plant to obtain or produce
    energy (carbohydrates) or nutrients, including photosynthesis and various saprophytic
    and carnivorous energy and nutrient acquisition mechanisms.
  comments: Although the majority of vascular plants use photosynthesis to produce
    their own carbohydrates, this trait mostly includes data for the few taxa that
    are not photosynthetic. Likewise, it captures alternative nutrient acquisition
    strategies. See also the trait `parasitic` which captures data on whether plants
    are parasitic (or partially parasitic), forming haustoria to penetrate their host
    plant. The trait `root_structures` includes specialised root structures

  description: Ratio of stem count post-fire to basal stem count (e.g. grass tillers)
    pre-fire at an individual or population level. This trait is appropriate to score
    for plants that have many stems from the base (shrubs, herbs, graminoids) where
    the number of stems is censused both before and after the fire. It is a continuous
    measure of resprouting strength conditioned on initial size.
  comments: This trait will usually be recorded in natural or experimental systems
    subjected to a controlled burn, where stem counts can be censused both before
    and after a fire. However, it is appropriate to include data for any plants subjected
    to fire where the dead stems can still be counted post-fire.

  label: Plant vegetative response to disturbances other than fire
  description_encoded: A whole plant [PO:0000003] life history [ECOCORE:00000018]
    trait which is the ability [NCIT:C78209] of individual [EFO:0000542] plants to
    regenerate [GO:0031099] vegetatively (resprout [Cerrado:fire#PlantResprout]) from
    meristematic tissue [PO:0006079], buds [PO:0000055]) after a disturbance event
    [EnvThes:20373] other than a fire [ENVO:01000786] that causes 100% defoliation.
  description: A plant's ability to regenerate vegetatively (resprout) from a disturbance
    other than fire that causes 100% defoliation.
  comments: This trait explicitly refers to a plant's vegetative regeneration ability
    following a disturbance event other than fire. See other `resprouting_capacity`
    traits, `bud_bank_location`, and `clonal_spread_mechanism` for other information
    about a plant's ability to resprout. Just as post-fire resprouting capacity is
    documented in individuals that have suffered 100% leaf scorch, this trait should
    be scored only on individuals that have suffered 100% leaf loss. If a different
    leaf loss percentage is used, this needs to be documented as a context property.

    are several fire-related context properties that should be documented whenever
    possible, including fire severity (most important), fire season, and fire frequency.
    In addition, the time from fire to recruitment will vary greatly across systems,

  description: The density of the fuel bed, the plant litter accumulated on the ground.
    It is calculated as the ratio of the mass of the fuel bed to the fuel bed volume.
