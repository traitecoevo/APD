Here, information pertaining to where a plant grows is captured by `plant_growth_substrate`. Terminology about the shape and length of stems and distribution of leaves is included in `stem_growth_habit`. An indication of whether a plant is parasitic is presented in `parasitic`. Included in the list of plant growth forms are two terms that are exclusively used to describe Australian plants, mallee and hummock, and one, tussock, that is an important growth form of Australian grasses, but globally used less frequently.",categorical,,,,lycophyte,"A taxonomic grouping that includes quillworts, clubmosses, and selaginella.",,none,whole plant phenotype trait; whole plant morphology trait; stem morphology trait,whole plant; stem; leaf,"organismal quality; spatial pattern, distribution; shape; structure; height","vegetative shoot system; wood, secondary xylem; growth; canopy",Pérez-Harguindeguy 2013 (https://doi.org/10.1071/BT12225); Simpson 2019 (https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9780128126288); Cornellison 2003 (https://doi.org/10.1071/BT02124),Elizabeth Wenk (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5640-5910); Hervé Sauquet (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8305-3236); Russell Barrett (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0360-8321); Ian J.
