https://w3id.org/APD/traits/trait_0012442,flower_gynoecium_placentation,Placentation,The different types of placentation in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia.,"In apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia, placentation is often described as marginal as the ovules are usually attached along the ventral slit (i.e., the zone where the carpel margins become postgenitally closed during carpel development). In syncarpous gynoecia there are three main types of placentation, 1) axile placentation refers to ovaries where the ovules are placed in the angle between carpel flanks in the center of the ovary; 2) in ovaries with parietal placentation the ovules attach to the ovary wall where two carpels meet; 3) in ovaries with free-central placentation the ovules are attached to a central column that emerges from the base of the ovary and protrudes into the non-septate ovary. It is not unusual that syncarpous gynoecia show a transition from proximally axile to a distally parietal placentation (e.g., Polemoniaceae). Basal and apical placentation may occur both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. Usually there is one longitudinal series of ovules attached to each carpel margin. However, both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia there may be more than one series of ovules at the flanks of a carpel. These latter cases are referred to as laminar (or laminar-diffuse) placentation (e.g., in some Nymphaeaceae). A placenta that is protruding from its surroundings and has more than two series of ovules (either axile or parietal) is called protruding-diffuse.

https://w3id.org/APD/traits/trait_0012461,flower_perianth_differentiation,Perianth differentiation,The ways in which perianth organs may look different from each other in a given flower.,"Typically, outer perianth parts are sepaloid and protect the other floral organs during floral development, while inner organs are often petaloid and play a role in pollinator attraction (Endress, 1994). However, it is also possible that all parts are either sepaloid or petaloid but remain differentiated in shape, size, and/or texture. In case of spiral perianths, differentiation may be continuous (i.e., gradual), whereby two successively initiated organs are very similar or only slightly different, while the outermost and innermost organs at both ends of the spiral are very different from each other (e.g., Chimonanthus). In the special case of perianths consisting of a single whorl, they are scored as undifferentiated. This perianth differentiation trait may be seen as both functional (the parting vs. sharing of functions among perianth parts) and developmental (the expression of a genetic program for different forms of perianth parts vs. a single program for a single type of perianth part morphology). Within-whorl differentiation, whereby organs of the same whorl take different forms, is common in zygomorphic flowers (e.g., Balsaminaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae) but is not taken into account with this trait.
